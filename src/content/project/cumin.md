Cumin is a **scalable and secure** task management tool designed by leveraging a modern **microservices architecture** with a focus on scalability, security, and real-time collaboration. The backend is built with **Node.js** and operates through NGINX as a reverse proxy, ensuring seamless API management. JWT-based authentication safeguards user data on the **React** frontend, while **WebSockets** enable real-time notifications for a dynamic user experience.

Cumin also takes full advantage of **AWS services** to ensure high availability and efficiency. **Amazon RDS** (PostgreSQL) and **Amazon DynamoDB** provide a hybrid approach to structured and NoSQL data storage, while **Amazon SQS** facilitates reliable message queueing for asynchronous processes. **AWS Lambda** is used to handle background tasks efficiently, and **Amazon S3** offers scalable storage for user data.

More features coming soon! Stay tuned for updates and checkout the code ðŸ‘‰
